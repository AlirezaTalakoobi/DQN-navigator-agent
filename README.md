# introduction
In this project I wanted to train a navigator agent in a simulation environment that can gather blue cubes and can get away from colliding with red cubes.
I have used Deep Q-metwork algorithm to train my agent.

this project consists of 4 different files:
1. Simulation
2. Neural Network code
3. DQN code
4. main code

*important: you can find project description in presentation.pptx*
